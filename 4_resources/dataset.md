# RflyMAD: A Dataset for Multicopter Fault Detection and Health Assessment

This site presents the **RflyMAD dataset** which is used for multicopter fault detection and isolation (FDI) or health assessment (HA). The dataset is collected from RflySim platform and real flight by Beihang Reliable Flight Control Group (Rfly). There are **5629 flight cases** in total in the dataset, **2566** for software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulatin, **2566** for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and **497** for real flight. The dataset includes **11 types of common faults** under **6 flight statuses** to cover more occasions in which the multicopters have different mobility levels when faults occur.

## 1. What is RflyMAD?
Different from research fields like computer vision, batteries, and mechanical vibration, there are relatively few publicly datasets related to the FDI, PHM and HA problems of aircraft systems. Regarding the lack of fault dataset, we form RflyMAD dataset. The RflyMAD dataset contains both simulation and real flight data, and covers sufficient fault types and flight statuses, ensuring both quantity and quality.

The hierarchy of RflyMAD dataset is shown in the following figure.

Note: In `Real Flight Data`, there are extra **wind data** about velocity and direction at the experiment time recorded in the dataset.

### 1.1 Varied Multicopters
<img src="./plane_droneyee.png" style="zoom: 35%;" />

In real flight experiments, in order to enhance the generalization of the dataset, three multicopters with different diagonal sizes are used to collect data. They are Droneyee X200 (Diagonal size of 200mm, 1.054kg), Droneyee X450 (Diagonal size of 450mm, 2.084kg) and Droneyee X680 (Diagonal size of 680mm, 4.068kg).

Note: The physical parameters of multicopter dynamic model uesd in SIL simulation and HIL simulation are achieved from Droneyee X450, including weights, moment of inertia and motor parameters.

### 1.2 Broad Fault Types
There are 11 fault types in RflyMAD dataset, including actuators, sensors of the multicopter and environmental effects. The exact cases in each fault type are listed in the following table.

| Type of Faults | SIL Simulation | HIL Simulation | Real Flight |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Motor(1-4)     | 921            | 921            | 231         |
| Propeller(1-4) | 435            | 435            | $\times$    |
| Low Voltage    | 20             | 20             | $\times$    |

| Magnetometer   | 128            | 128            | 20          |
| Barometer      | 128            | 128            | 20          |
| GPS            | 128            | 128            | 20          |
| No Fault       | 200            | 200            | 84          |
| Total          | 2566           | 2566           | 497         |

Note: $\times$ represents this item does not exist in sub-dataset and the number means the amount of corrresponding cases. 

Motor(1-4) represents the number of failure motors is in range of 1 to 4.

### 1.3 Sufficient Flight Statuses

The following table lists all 6 flight statuses in this dataset. 

|Flight status      |SIL Simulation|HIL Simulation|Real Flight|
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
|Hover              |$\surd$       |$\surd$       |$\surd$    |
|Waypoints          |$\surd$       |$\surd$       |$\surd$    |
|Velocity Control   |$\surd$       |$\surd$       |$\surd$    |
|Circling           |$\surd$       |$\surd$       |$\surd$    |
|Acceleration       |$\surd$       |$\surd$       |$\surd$    |
|Deceleration       |$\surd$       |$\surd$       |$\times$   |

Note: $\surd$ represents this item exists in sub-dataset and $\times$ represents not.

### 1.4 Exact Data in One Flight Case

As shown in the figure of dataset hierarchy, each flight within the dataset contains four types of raw data and their processed files, and they could be described as follows:
- `Flight information`: It contains the flight command (e.g., take off, land and move to a target position), fault types and fault parameters.
- `ULog`: PX4 uses it to log uORB topics as messages, including device inputs (e.g., sensors, RC inputs), internal state(e.g., attitude, EKF states), and String messages.
- `Telemetry log`: TLog is recorded by the ground station, and the main content is the information sent and received between a multicopter and its corresponding QGC. Thus frequency of transmission is decided by the communication quality in real flight or the performance of the simulation computer.
- `Ground Truth Data`: This data is generated by the RflySim platform during the simulation and recorded at a frequency of 120Hz. It contains the kinematics information, fault states and motor speeds. This data is abbreviated as "GTData" in the following text.
- `BAG`: The BAG file is generated by the ROS system in each real flight. It contains the position, attitude, and control commands of the multicopter.

Note: It is worth noting that the `GTData` only exists in simulation data and the `BAG` files only in real flight data, so there are still four types of data associated with each flight.

## 5. Samples
Here we show two examples to diagnose faults of multicopters by using data in RflyMAD. The one is data-driven method and the other one is model-based method. On the one hand, users could learn how to use RflyMAD in their research by these two examples. And on the other hand, the support relationship between the simulation and real flight data is also be verified by the transfer learning method.

### 5.1 Data-driven Method --- Transfer Learning
The detailed methods and results can be accessed from [Supplementary experiments to verify data support ability based on transfer learning](./transfer_leanring.html).

### 5.2 Model-based Method --- Kalman Filter
In this method, we use Kalman Filter to estimate the fault conditions of one flight case in RflyMAD dataset. The detailed information about how a simplified dynamic model is established for the multicopter and how to use kalman filtering method in the process of fault diagnosis while utilizing appropriate data can be found in the [Model-based Method: Kalman Filter](./model_based_KF.html).
