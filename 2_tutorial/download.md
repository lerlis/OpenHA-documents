# Download and Install

## Stable Version

The latest stable release of OpenHA will be hosted on PyPi soon.
Right now, you need to visit the [release page](https://github.com/rfly-openha/OpenHA/releases) to download the latest version of OpenHA.
For most users (unless you want to contribute to the development of OpenHA), this version will be adequate.

To install from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
pip install "the-path-of-whl-file"
```

## Pre-Release

Users who would like to contribute to OpenHA or would like to use pre-release features can do so using the OpenHA GitHub repo.
This isn't recommended for most users as this version may be unstable.
To do this, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rfly-openha/OpenHA
cd OpenHA
pip install -e .
```
