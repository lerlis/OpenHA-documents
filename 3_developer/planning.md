# Future Planning of OpenHA

The plans of the OpenHA are addressed on this page.
Developers from all over the world are welcome to join us, and we need your help indeed.
Please tell us if you have some excellent ideas or suggestions about OpenHA.
Feel free to contact us via email: qq_buaa@buaa.edu.cn, or report issues on GitHub.

## From a Single Quadcopter to Multiple Configurations

The aircraft model we used for SIL and HIL experiments is a quadcopter whose mathematical model and parameters are introduced on [another page](../4_resources/multicopter.html).

In the future, other multicopters with different configurations should be introduced in the simulation experiments and even real flight experiments.
The volume of RflyMAD will be largely extended at that time.

It also can be foreseen that it's quite a time- and money-consuming work.
It may take us quite a long time to achieve this goal.

## From UAV to other Unmanned Platforms

The methods, functions, and examples integrated into the OpenHA so far are mainly for rotor aircraft since we have researched them for long years.

In the future, we would like to make OpenHA applicable for other unmanned platforms such as unmanned fixed wings, unmanned vehicles, unmanned ships, etc.
It's apparently impossible to achieve this just by us.
So we look forward to cooperating with other labs or researchers to make it happen.

## Developing Health Assessment Module for GCS

GCS is short for Ground Control Station, an essential part of the aircraft system.
It can be used to plan trajectories, send commands, and monitor the states of aircraft when aircraft are flying in the air.

There are many open-source GCS software, two of which are QGroundControl and MissionPlanner.
We are aimed to develop the health assessment modules for these open-source QGCs and make it easier for the end users to know about the OpenHA.
So we may need more professional developers to help us.

## Conclusion

All the points above are long-term plans, and it's meant to take quite a long time to cross the check boxes finally.
So we need your help if possible.
Attention for another time. Feel free to contact us; we need your help.
