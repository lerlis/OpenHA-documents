# Custom API Development

As an open-source health assessment framework, we strive to build this platform into an open, sharing, and mutually beneficial community.
We welcome like-minded friends and partners to join in the development and maintenance of this framework, and we appreciate your selfless contributions.

Here, we will explain and clarify some points of attention in the process of development and contribution.
We urge contributors to read carefully.

## Identify Position and Goals

As introduced in the [Architecture](../1_introduction/what.html#structure), this framework includes core libraries, data processing, health assessment (including health attribute assessment and system health assessment), and health prediction modules.
Therefore, contributors should identify the best classification of their custom functions based on the function and purpose of them.

## Programming

The current framework is based on the Python language.
In the development process, certain guidelines and standards should be followed to facilitate user understanding and the reading and understanding of other code contributors.
For this purpose, we have referenced the coding standards of other open-source software and formulated some basic development rules and guidelines.
Contributors can refer to the `Code Contribution Guide` and [Code Style](./style.html) to learn more.

## Documentation and Examples

Contributors should also improve the documentation and necessary simple examples of the function to facilitate user reference.

On the basis of clear and understandable function comments, enriching and improving the documentation is a relatively easy and simple task.
For the format, you can refer to the [template](../2_tutorial/template_of_document.html), and the file name should be consistent with the function or class name and place it in the `/2_tutorial/` directory.
